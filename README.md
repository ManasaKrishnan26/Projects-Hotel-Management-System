# Hotel-Management-system 

Database management systems are prevalent across various fields for displaying information about a system, querying user details, updating, creating and deleting user information. In this project, we use a system that provides information regarding different hotels and their management system. The system aims at creating, deleting and updating guest information on their database. It also provides an interactive user interface in the form of a dashboard that analyses the hotel information in the form of graphical statistical analysis. The system utilizes Python for visualisation and analysis using prediction and classification algorithms and MySQL workbench to create queries that can potentially make changes to the database. With this system, hotels can improve the robustness of their services by recognizing important patterns such as the cancellation of reservations.
